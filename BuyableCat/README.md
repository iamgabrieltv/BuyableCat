# BuyableCat

This mod allows you to purchase a cat from the [NeedyCats](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Jordo/NeedyCats/) mod from the store. Price is 50 by default but can be changed in the config.

# Known Bugs

- ~~Cat doesn't show in multiplayer for clients unless the host interacts with it~~ should be fixed as of 2.0.3
- ~~Currently blocks the ability to buy cat food~~ Cat Food was renamed to CatFood in the shop and has to be bought with `Buy CatFood`
